**Introduction**

Imagine owning a piece of a company that pays you a growing stream of income, year after year, for decades. Sounds too good to be true? Welcome to the world of Dividend Aristocrats. These are companies that have increased their dividend payments for 25+ years, providing a relatively stable source of income for investors. In this article, we'll explore what Dividend Aristocrats are, why they matter to teens, and how to get started with investing in them.

**What Is It?**
----------------

A Dividend Aristocrat is a company that has increased its dividend payout for 25 or more consecutive years. This achievement requires a strong financial foundation, a proven business model, and a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index tracks these companies, providing a benchmark for investors.

**Why Should Teens Care?**

As a teen, you might wonder why Dividend Aristocrats matter to you. Here's the thing: investing in these companies can help you build wealth over time. Think of it like a snowball rolling down a hill, gaining size and momentum. By investing in Dividend Aristocrats, you can create a stream of passive income that can help you achieve your long-term goals, such as funding your education, buying a car, or even retiring early.

**Key Concepts**
-----------------

Before we dive into real-world examples, let's break down some key concepts:

* **Dividend Yield**: The ratio of the annual dividend payment to the stock's current price. A higher yield generally indicates a more attractive investment.
* **Payout Ratio**: The percentage of earnings paid out as dividends. A sustainable payout ratio is essential for maintaining dividend growth.
* **Dividend Growth Rate**: The rate at which a company increases its dividend payment over time. A high growth rate can lead to significant wealth creation.

**Real-World Examples**

Let's look at some examples of Dividend Aristocrats:

* **Procter & Gamble (PG)**: This consumer goods giant has increased its dividend for 64 consecutive years, with a current dividend yield of around 2.5%.
* **Coca-Cola (KO)**: With a dividend growth streak of 58 years, Coca-Cola is a classic example of a Dividend Aristocrat. Its current dividend yield is around 3.1%.
* **3M (MMM)**: This industrial conglomerate has increased its dividend for 102 years, making it one of the longest-running Dividend Aristocrats. Its current dividend yield is around 3.4%.
